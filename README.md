# Multilingual Blocks
Plugin adds option to display Gutenberg block only in one language. Works with Polylang and enables for example displaying widgets only in selected language - the option which isn't in free version anymore.

TO DO:
- Get all website languages, instead of hard coding them.
- Enable to display block in more than one language and not all (for example two selected languages).


Use 'npm run build' to build scripts and dependencies.
